For many years I've believed that we need something like "smarter C" or "modern C++". Then I've started to use Ruby, and loved it. However, the performance was not good enough to use it as an only language. I've tried to write an optimizing Ruby compiler, only to discover that by the very definition, Ruby can't be fast (it can be *fast enough* though). 

So, the basic idea is that you can use Dab to create everything - from low-level, close to the metal code to high-level DSL-based applications. Optimize for productivity first, and for performance only if necessary.
